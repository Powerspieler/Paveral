# Paveral
This is a ****Java-Plugin for Paper-Servers**** which adds a few items and a way of crafting them. This is meant to be a little addition to tweak the vanilla survival gameplay.

Resourcepack: [https://github.com/Powerspieler/Paveral-Resourcepack](https://github.com/Powerspieler/Paveral-Resourcepack)

## About
All of the items are meant to be late-game content, therefore the whole story begins by killing a shulker in an endcity.
But some books can also be found in overworld chests before that. They tell different stories in which there are hints to various items. Some items can also be found and they have to be disassembled to learn about their "forming"-ingredients.

### Items
#### Bonk-Stick
Just a knockback stick. But this whole plugin started with this one silly idea.

#### Creeper Defuser
Creepers do not break any blocks around players having it in their inventory or inside an item frame.

#### Bedrock Breaker
Like the name is already telling, it breaks bedrock. But it comes with its price.

#### Lightning Rod
A staff shooting a lightning, which provides a protection against phantoms.

#### Lightstaff
Light up dark areas with invisible light sources. Light level can be adjusted.

#### ... and more
